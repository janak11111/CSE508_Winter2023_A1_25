study secondorder supersonic flow theory attempt made develop second approximation solution problems supersonic flow solved existing firstorder theory method attack adopted iteration process using linearized solution first step plane flow found particular integral iteration equation written terms firstorder solution secondorder problem thereby reduced equivalent firstorder problem readily solved surface isolated body solution reduces wellknown result busemann plane case considered detail insofar gives insight nature iteration process axially symmetric flow problem reduced firstorder problem discovery particular integral smooth bodies secondorder solution calculated method von karman moore bodies corners also treated slight modification method secondorder solution cones represents considerable improvement linearized result secondorder theory also agrees well several solutions bodies revolution calculated numerical method characteristics full threedimensional flow partial particular integral found example general problem solution derived inclined cone possibility treating inclined bodies revolution threedimensional wings discussed briefly
