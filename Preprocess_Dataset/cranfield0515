self sustained oscillations system nonlinear damping particular type paper deals selfsustained oscillations dynamic system single degree freedom linear restoring force nonlinear damping force latter supposed function velocity representable simple polygonal graph damping negative small velocities becomes positive velocities certain value assumptions rigorous solution presented including equations motion amplitude maximum velocity period simple solution obtained limiting case vanishingly small damping approximate solution series powers damping ratio worked gives satisfactory accuracy quite large values
