comments inversion large structural matrices recent note klein referred paper coauthored writer ref 3 regarding subject inversion largeorder matrices klein stated would show that situation hopeless anovementioned authors intimate purpose note take exception kleins conclusions rather disagree implication authors ref 2 pessimistic respect largematrix inversions two general methods analysis treated method consistent distortion method transfer matrices first method leads directly relatively large matrix structural coefficients internal forces displacements matrix must inverted solve problem second method ultimately produces relatively small matrix requiring inversion however arrive point one must perform number matrix multiplications
