note creep buckling columns method estimating allowable load capacities columns subject creep presented method utilizes approximate stress distributions derived isochronousstressstrain curves estimate column load capacities shown conservative time estimate made application method made test data asreceived stabilized 24st4 aluminum alloy comparison computed column capacities experimental capacities indicates method satisfactory estimating decrease capacity increasing time easily obtained timedependent tangentmodulus loads discussed interpreted approximations allowable loadcapacity estimates limited application made test data results appear promising concluded certain limitations recognized method may prove useful simplicity presentation results experimental investigation effects column imperfection columnmaterial variation made found columncapacity variations order 10 per cent result columnimperfection differences columnmaterial variation results experimental study variation column capacity temperature exposure presented indicate column efficiency measured decrease capacity acceptable short times higher temperatures efficiency higher temperatures falls rapidly however increasing time
