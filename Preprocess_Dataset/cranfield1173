buckling cylindrical shells longitudinally varying loads two problems illustrating effect nonuniformity loading buckling characteristics circular cylinders investigated first problem deals effect linearly varying axial compressive stress would produced weight propellant solidpropellant engine case results indicate ratio maximum critical compressive stress induced shear load critical uniform compressive stress varies 19 curvature parameter z equal 16 z becomes infinite particular increase stress less 20 per sq ft z greater 100 stability thin cylinders loaded lateral external pressure varying linearly longitudinal direction also investigated results indicate z greater 100 buckling coefficients proportional square root z
