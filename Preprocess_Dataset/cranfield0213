performance supersonic turbine nozzles investigation conducted national gas turbine establishment performance turbines high pressure ratios per stage present report discusses mode operation supersonic nozzles turbines describes cascade experiment theory experiment demonstrate conditions imposed upon supersonic flow immediately downstream nozzles eg following row rotor blades exert overriding influence upon nozzle outlet flow angle hence upon maximum pressure ratio obtainable across nozzle providing axial component velocity subsonic important difference familiar flow subsonic turbine nozzles example downstream gas angle controlled predominantly nozzle blade shape spacing suitable test technique using closedjet tunnel demonstrated particular nozzles tested convergentdivergent form straightsided divergent portion axial direction design mach number 2 flow found well behaved regards shock pattern losses starting range pressure ratios tested 9 1 19 1 particular efficiency design pressure ratio 166 1 high velocity coefficient calculated traverses pitot static tubes 098 conversion pitot total pressure mach number 25 high accuracy important measurement static pressure nevertheless readings conventional fourhole instrument appear reliable
