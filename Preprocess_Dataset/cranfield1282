compressible flatplate boundarylayer flow applied magnetic field laminar boundarylayer equations formulated solved flat plate highspeed compressible air flow equilibrium dissociation ionization assumed applied magnetic field component normal plate proportional skinfriction heattransfer characteristics determined freestream velocities 17500 meters sec magnetic fields results show skin friction heat transfer given freestream velocity decrease increasing magnetic field strength percentage reduction constant along length plate also exhibit hysteresis behavior first found case magnetoaerodynamic couette flow however flat plate hysteresis effect disappears higher mach number furthermore found reduction heat transfer increasing field strength opposite behavior couette flow
