calibration standard pitotstatic head used rae low speed wind tunnels recent results tests rae wind tunnels concerned measurement pressure distributions shown slight discrepancies readings various static pressure tubes calculated pressure distributions consequence doubt felt concerning calibrations tunnel static pressure upon validity reading given standard pitotstatic head therefore decided check standard pitotstatic head used rae wind tunnels instrument similar measurements static pressure also made using long tube interference head support calculated small note gives results tests made 5 ft open jet wind tunnel 1 11 ft wind tunnel order determine necessary correction reading static pressure given rae pitotstatic head tests made september october 1951
