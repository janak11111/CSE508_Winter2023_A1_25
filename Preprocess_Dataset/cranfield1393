heat transfer near forward stagnation point body revolution order determine temperature distribution body moving atmosphere knowledge local heattransfer coefficients required slender sharpnosed bodies heattransfer coefficients frequently approximated using comparable flatplate values however bluntnosed bodies flatplate solutions applicable near forward stagnation point since greatest rate heat transfer may occur forward stagnation point value investigated note theoretical solution given heat transfer near forward stagnation point body revolution assuming laminar incompressible lowspeed flow comparable solution twodimensional flow given squire case bluntnosed body moving supersonic velocity flow behind central portion bow wave subsonic possible lowspeed solution using freestream conditions behind center bow wave apply near stagnation point
