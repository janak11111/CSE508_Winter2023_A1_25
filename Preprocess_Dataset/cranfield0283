laminar heat transfer around blunt bodies dissociated air method predicting laminar heattransfer rates blunt highly cooled bodies constant wall temperature dissociated air flow developed attention restricted case axisymmetric bodies zero incidence although twodimensional bodies could treated way method based use local similarity concept extension ideas used fay riddell simple formula given predicting ratio local heattransfer rate stagnationpoint rate depends wall conditions pressure distribution thermodynamic transport properties hot external flow except stagnation point experimental heattransfer rates obtained correct stagnationpoint simulation high wall cooling shock tubes also presented compared theoretical predictions whole agreement good although regions rapidly varying pressure evidence local similarity assumption breaks theory underestimates actual heattransfer rate 25 per cent
