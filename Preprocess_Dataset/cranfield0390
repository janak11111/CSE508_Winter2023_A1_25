panelflutter studies using piston theory use piston theory recently advocated supersonic aeroelastic analyses including problem panel flutter stimulated investigation reported linear piston theory mainly considered effects introducing higher order terms discussed flutter rectangular simply supported panels elliptically shaped clampededge panels considered justification provided use static aerodynamic forces neglect aerodynamic damping hence concluded ackeret loading gives exact results piston theory solution flutter equations made applying galerkin s method rayleightype analysis using assumed modes deformation
