note creep buckling columns results shorttime elevatedtemperature creep tests objective obtaining procedures predicting column lifetime semiempirical lifetime curves obtained aid previously published column creep theory used deriving column curves semiempirical lifetime curves also used study effect varying applied stress outofstraightness range considered small variations outofstraightness found little practical significance whereas small stress variations change column lifetime considerably range outofstraightness encountered tests data presented plots explicitly include outofstraightness plots type satisfactory predicting column lifetime design purposes
