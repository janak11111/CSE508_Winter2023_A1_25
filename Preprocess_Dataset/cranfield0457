laminar boundarylayer flow near position separation singularities considered solution laminar boundarylayer equations position separation singularity type considered occurred careful numerical computation hartree linearly decreasing velocity distribution outside boundary layer may occur generally whenever occur boundarylayer equations cease valid near separation upstream side also downstream separation work suggests singularities may arise solution nonlinear parabolic equations due nonlinearity formulae found may help computers laminar boundary layers desire rough solution endpoint aim
