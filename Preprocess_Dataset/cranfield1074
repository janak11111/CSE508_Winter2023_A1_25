theoretical experimental investigation secondorder supersonic wingbody interference approximate secondorder solutions supersonic flow around wingbody combinations calculated using two different theoretical models small wing sweep small comparison mach cone considered analysis restricted high mach numbers m2 1 approximate formula common two models found secondorder interference term formula also used correct experimental pressure distributions effect nonuniformities windtunnel flow order test theory windtunnel experiments nonlifting conecylinder bodies combination wings simple shapes performed pressure distributions measured 3 4 around bodies wings separately well combination found secondorder interference predicted reasonably well simplified theory
