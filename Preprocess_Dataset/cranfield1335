use freon12 fluid aerodynamic testing thermodynamic properties freon12 investigated determine possibilities use gas fluid aerodynamic testing values velocity sound freon12 less onehalf air presented functions temperatures pressure including measurements room temperature density freon12 four times air changes state freon12 may predicted means ideal gas law accuracy better 1 percent pressures freon12 shown condense adiabatic expansion normal conditions mach number 3 values ratio specific heats freon12 lower air therefore additional parameter introduced must considered comparisons made aerodynamic tests using freon12 using air time lag vibrational heat capacity freon12 change temperature measured found order 2 x 10 second atmospheric temperature pressure time short important energy dissipations result engineering applications
