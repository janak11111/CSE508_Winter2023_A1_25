influence coefficients real gases analysis onedimensional fluidflow problems often assumed behavior medium perfect gas assumption justified provided pressure temperature range interest small near atmospheric higher pressures temperatures various deviations introduced thereby causing deviations results obtained using ideal fluidflow equations note influence coefficients similar developed shapiro presented case real gases analysis based upon use various functions compressibility factor emmons assumptions made follows 1 flow onedimensional steady 2 changes stream properties continuous 3 flow comprised imperfect gases
