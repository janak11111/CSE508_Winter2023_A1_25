ionization nonequilibrium expanding flows approximate methods developed solving electronion kinetic equations expanding quasi onedimensional airflows results obtained inviscid nozzle flows conditions appropriate shock tunnel testing compared exact numerical solutions effects rf transmission dc conductivity examined since twobody deionization never fully freezes flows considered assumption sudden freezing gives upper bound residual ionization large area ratios use asymptotic form solution freezing criterion provides improved estimate cases ionization nonequilibrium also considered plasma sheath associated blunt hypersonic bodies flying high altitudes influence atomic ions examined typical reentry conditions
