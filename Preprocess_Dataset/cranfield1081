numerical solution navierstokes equations flow around circular cylinder reynolds number 40 steady twodimensional flow around circular cylinder submerged viscous fluid case r 40 investigated integrating numerically exact navierstokes equations main results follows i steady flow solution exists even reynolds number high 40 moreover seems solution goes smoothly solution kirchhoff discontinuous flow theory seems limiting flow case r ii flow pattern coefficients pressure drag good agreement experimental data
