several approximate analyses bending rectangular cantilever plate uniform normal pressure three methods approximating deflections moments occurring rectangular cantilever plate subjected uniform normal pressure entire surface presented paper first application wellknown finitedifference procedure second third collocation methods one based upon polynomial solutions lagrange equation employing mixed hyperbolictrigonometric terms satisfying equation last two methods boundary conditions satisfied exactly along clamped edge finite number points along free edges plate results obtained particular case cantilever plate uniform normal load indicate use relatively small number points collocation method yields values deflections moments substantial agreement given finitedifference procedure concluded results collocation method using assumed functions give satisfactory results fewer points finitedifference method cantilever plates loading different one investigated
