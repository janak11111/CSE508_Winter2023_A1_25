aerodynamic heating blunt nose shapes mach numbers 14 results presented recent investigations aerodynamic heating rates blunt nose shapes mach numbers 14 data obtained flight windtunnel tests shown flatfaced cylinder 50 percent stagnationpoint heating rates hemisphere nearly entire mach number range tests made mach number 2 series bodies made hemispherical segments varying radius curvature showed slight amounts curvature decrease local rates edge flatfaced cylinders slight increase stagnation rate total heat transfer slightly curved bodies also somewhat smaller total heat transfer flatfaced cylinders comparison several tests theoretical heatingrate distributions showed laminar turbulent local rates predicted available theories given pressure distribution body reasonably well although scatter available data still leaves open choice theories edge bodies usually differ tests flatfaced cylinder mach number 249 angles attack 15degree showed movement apparent stagnation point center body 50 percent windward station creased 30 percent near leeward edge decreased 20 percent 15degree angle attack preliminary results concave nose indicated possibility type design may developed give heating rates significantly lower even flatfaced cylinder rates test results also shown however existence unsteady flow phenomenon increase heating rates extremely high values
